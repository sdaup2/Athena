# Getting started with Athena

# Codebase Structure

The codebase consists of two main repositories: 
    - Athena, which controls the front-end components of the website.
    - athena_backend, which controls the backend functionality. 

The tech stack we used for our codebase is: 
    - React on the front-end.
    - Express on the backend.


# Deployment

Before being able to deploy the codebase, the Firebase and NodeJS libraries must be locally installed. After installing these libraries, follow the steps below to run the codebase: 

    - Open the athena_backend repository in a code editor and navigate to the terminal. 
    - Type “npm start” to initiate the backend. 
    - Open the Athena repository in a code editor and navigate to the terminal.
    - Navigate to the client folder of the codebase (cd client).
    - Type “npm start” to initiate the front-end. 
    - A new tab should open up on your browser displaying the Athena website. 


# Frontend Organization

There are a couple of main folders/elements in the frontend: 

    - assets: Holds all the of the images used throughout the code. 
    - components: Holds the page components (e.g., the header and footer) that are used in other pages 
    - pages: Holds the pages of the websites themselves, these are the screens that can be pulled up in Athena. 


# Additional Notes

    - Comments on the code's functions are included in each file to help with adjusting to the codebase.
