Codebase Structure

The codebase consists of two main repositories: 
    - Athena, which controls the front-end components of the website.
    - athena_backend, which controls the backend functionality. 

The tech stack we used for our codebase is: 
    - React on the front-end.
    - Express on the backend.


Deployment

Before being able to deploy the codebase, the Firebase and NodeJS libraries must be locally installed. After installing these libraries, follow the steps below to run the codebase: 

    - Open the athena_backend repository in a code editor and navigate to the    
      terminal. 
    - Type “npm start” to initiate the backend. 
    - Open the Athena repository in a code editor and navigate to the terminal.
    - Navigate to the client folder of the codebase (cd client).
    - Type “npm start” to initiate the front-end. 
    - A new tab should open up on your browser displaying the Athena website.
